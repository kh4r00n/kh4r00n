# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phylyp


Technology enthusiast. I started my journey learning to program in Python, soon after I became more interested in programming through Rhinoceros3D and Grasshopper software, where it was possible to create designs through visual programming and in QGIS Software where I performed spatial data analysis.

I am currently a graduate student in Information Systems. I have experience with python, ETL, pandas, pyspark and sql.

I enjoy reading and studying Japanese in my spare time. My biggest interests in Technology are Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to learn more about Machine learning, Deep Learning, Big Data, Data Engineering. 

I'm currently studying data structure, C and shell scripting. In April/2022 I start the Basecamp of 42 SÃ£o Paulo (also known as The Piscine of 42). 42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The Basecamp(C Piscine) is a 26 days C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).
